    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We are two close friends from Sweden driven by a shared passion for adventure, endurance and the wild unknown. As combat medics and ultra-endurance athletes, we thrive in physically and mentally demanding environments. Our backgrounds in mountaineering, long-distance trekking, and backcountry expeditions have taken us across glaciers, deserts, and remote alpine ranges.

      In the summer of 2025, we crossed Iceland from the north coast to the south coast on foot - an unforgettable 8-day journey through volcanic landscapes, river crossings, and total solitude. That adventure became the start of this blog. Through this platform, we share our experiences, honest gear reviews, route info, and expedition planning tips - to inspire others to push beyond the ordinary.
