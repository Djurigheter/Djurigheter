      <p>
        During the summer of 2025, we set out on an expedition to cross Iceland on foot completely self-supported. This route took us through lava deserts, glacial rivers, mossy valleys, and brutally remote landscapes. We carried everything on our backs and avoided any paid accommodation or resupply points.
The idea came to life just a few weeks earlier. During our research we found little to no information about how to do it and if it was even possible. 
The thought of a difficult expedition, almost no one else had done, was enough for us to book a one-way ticket and start our journey. In this blog we cover everything from preparation, planning, gear and breakdown from start to finish of the Iceland crossing. By this we hope to inspire others to go out and try to beat our time.   </p>

      <h3>Route Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Starting at the town of Akureyri in the north, we followed a mix of off-trail navigation, F-roads, and hiking routes through the Highlands. Major points included the Sprengisandur desert, Nýidalur and finally descending via Landmannalaugar into Skógar.
      </p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple glacial river crossings</li>
        <li>High winds and snow in the Highlands (even in July!)</li>
        <li>Carrying 15 days of food at the start</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Gear Highlights</h3>
      <p>
        We used ultralight tents, trail running shoes, and a mix of homemade and pre-bought dehydrated meals to save weight. Navigation was done via GPS and printed maps as backup.
      </p>

      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        Iceland rewards those who are prepared, humble, and flexible. We learned a lot about ourselves, the land, and each other.
