        During the summer of 2025, we set out on an expedition to cross Iceland on foot completely self-supported. This route took us through lava deserts, glacial rivers, mossy valleys, and brutally remote landscapes. We carried everything on our backs and avoided any paid accommodation or resupply points.
The idea came to life just a few weeks earlier. During our research we found little to no information about how to do it and if it was even possible. 
The thought of a difficult expedition, almost no one else had done, was enough for us to book a one-way ticket and start our journey. In this blog we cover everything from preparation, planning, gear and breakdown from start to finish of the Iceland crossing. By this we hope to inspire others to go out and try to beat our time.   </p>

      <h3>Planning of the route</h3>
</p>
        <p>
        Crossing the country from shore to shore is probably the biggest challenge for hikers when coming to Iceland. When choosing a path there are numerous different aspects to think about and possible routes to choose from. 
The first one connects the two extreme points and starts in Rifstangi, which is the most northern point on the mainland and goes down over the highlands all the way to Kötlutangi, the southernmost point. 
The length of this route is approximately 560km and mostly follow F-roads (Jeep roads that cross the highland) and hiking trails. 
           <br>
Another option, and the one we opted for, goes from the north coast to south coast starting in Akureyri and finishing down south by Skógar. This option is approximately 350 - 400 km depending on exact starting / finishing point and choice of route along the way. This is probably the fastest and most recommended way of crossing the country of Iceland. Akureyri is the biggest town up north and is accessible from Reykjavik by bus. We opted to hitch hike which also worked out great. The longest and most challenging way crossing Iceland is from west to east. The recommended time is 3-4 weeks and since we don't have any experience about this, go to Andrew Skurkas web page, who's done it himself. 
           <br>

Whichever route you take, doing a hike like this might not be the most enjoyable challenge for most people. Mostly because of the all year round cold rainy weather, loneliness and long straight gravel roads. But for the small percentage of hikers who love the idea of doing something not a lot of others dare attempt, this is the perfect challenge. 
           <br>

When planning this, our biggest concern was that the infamous rivers on the highlands would be impossible to cross on foot. We were recommended by locals to contact the search and rescue teams and the huts out on the highlands to get information about the conditions, and to let them know of our planned expedition and estimated time of arrival at the end. This is for safety reasons, in case something would have happened and we would be in need of rescue. To be short, the office on google maps in Reykjavik didn’t exist and no one answered our phone calls. But if you are gonna try this yourself, please give it another go.

      <h3>Our gear</h3>
      
        When doing a long self-supported hike your gear is crucial for your success and comfort. Exact gear is very personal so we're not gonna give you our whole packing list but we can give you our style and standouts that worked for us. We always opt for the fast and light style where we use trailrunners and keep our bags as light as possible. We keep the tempo high and like to be able to jog the downhills and for that a light well packed bag is crucial. 
The weather on Iceland can get rough very fast. We had days where we dripped in sweat wearing shorts and t-shirts and one hour later we were freezing with multiple layers on. This means that you need to pack and be prepared for all temperatures and we’re sorry to tell you but if you're doing this, it's definitely gonna rain. We wouldn't recommend you to pack “stupid light” and cut down on warm pieces just to save a few grams, even if the weather forecast looks good. 


We kept our windbreakers, rain clothes, gloves and buff easily accessible since we had to take them on and off constantly. We packed our bags pretty much like for a normal mountain hiking trip. We made sure to have a good and comfortable sleeping system which in our case was an inflatable sleeping pad and a warm quilt. We obviously brought the essentials like a down jacket, good baselayers to sleep in and good waterproof gear to keep us dry. We both had 55 liter packs and ended up with a base weight of around 6 kilos. The real weight came when adding all our food and snacks, which we will get into later. 
<br>
This is what we ended up wearing most of the time. 
<br>
Now to the water, which ended up being trickier than expected. Being used to hiking in the mountains of Sweden and Norway, with fresh streams everywhere, water is never a problem. When asking the locals in Reykjavik about the water situation, we got told there were fresh streams everywhere, even on the highlands. Looking at the map and seeing the word “Icelandic dessert” we were still a bit unsure. We ended up bringing a Beefree water filter and drops from the Swedish brand Xinix. We also made sure to have a capacity of carrying 3-4 liters each if there were to be long stretches of drought. This ended up being a real life-saver since the highlands were a lot dryer than expected. We did come across big streams coming from the huge glaciers surrounding our route and sometimes frequently. But there were also stretches of over 30 km with no good water to be found. On the highlands we often had to get our water from small lakes, this is where our filtering system came in handy. So if you're planning on giving this hike a try, water planning and constantly looking at the map for the next refill is crucial. We often had to fill up 2 liters of water to carry to the next possible water refill we had seen on the map. When we later reached down to the more mountainous areas in the south, more water streams were found.

      </p>

       <h3>Food and water</h3>
      <p>
       Your food and water is very important when doing an expedition like this. The difficult part for us when planning how much to bring was to understand how long the hike was going to take us. We didn’t really know how fast and long days we could do since there isn't too much info about especially the highlands. But we know from experience that we can do long days and estimated a time between 10-14 days. The big gap was because of locals telling us that we might need to take big loops around rivers that were too deep to cross. Big loops that could add days to our time. To be safe and know that we weren't gonna run out of food, we took 15 days of food with us, which is a lot. But if you're not planning on doing big days like us, you might need even more. Our food consisted of freeze dried meals, some home made dried meals and lots of snacks. In the end we did manage to get a time of under 8 days due to us underestimating ourselves. So we had lots of food left that we actually ended up selling to a slightly underprepared Swizz hiker we met on the way.
 </p>
So now in Reykjavik that we had our food sorted, the idea before the hike was to find a way of sending packages to resupply points in the form of the mountain huts located around Iceland. This was so we wouldn't need to carry it all, and we had read this was gonna be possible. We had found one place on the way called the Nyudalur hut and well in Reykjavik we made a huge package with about half of our food, to try and send there. The Nyudalur hut is pretty much in the middle of the highlands and perfectly located. We reached out to pretty much every expedition company in Iceland and got the same answer from all of them, “We have unfortunately stopped delivering packages”. We were now left with the option to do it self-supported and carry all our food ourselves, or go back home to Sweden. We obviously took our package and started repacking our bags with food.

 <h3>Navigation</h3>
    
      </p>
      We like to have different options for navigation when in the wild to be able to keep moving, if maybe our phones and powerbanks run out of battery. We had downloaded the entire area offline in the Topo-gps and Garmin explore apps, which is what we ended up using most of the time. We also created a gpx file that could be sent to a Garmin fenix watch that we had. A classic compass and paper map is also always good and reliable, so we brought one covering pretty much the whole country. But to be honest, Iceland and its highland is pretty easily navigated if you're going straight through it, since you can just point the compass south and walk in a straight line. 
      <br>

      <h3>The hike itself</h3>
    
      Our days were long and we managed to keep a good pace. Starting our days at 7.30 and finishing at about 8-9 in the evening, we managed to put in 50-60 kilometers a day. Here comes a short summary of our days:
 <br>
      <h3>Day 1</h3>
      
      <p>
       We had set up camp pretty much in Akureyri and started walking down an asphalt road for like 6 hours, this is not recommended. When we later reached the mountains close to Akureyri, nature got beautiful. We also met our biggest enemy for the first time, the Icelandic flies (way worse than mosquitoes). A good 57 km in the legs. 
      </p>

      <br>
       <h3>Day 2</h3>
    
      <p>
       Starting in a beautiful valley in the mountains, we worked our way up and reached the infamous highlands. Cool views of endless stone dessert were paired with winds from the glaciers nearby and a feeling of being on another planet. We quickly realised this a pretty inhospitable place and maybe why crossing it on foot isn't too popular. 

      </p>
<br>
       <h3>Day 3</h3>
    
      <p>
       Long gravel roads, stone desert, rain and some bigger river crossings. A good description of the Icelandic highlands. We were really happy to be moving though.
      </p>
      <br>
       <h3>Day 4</h3>
    
      <p>
       More highlands, which kind of looks the same everywhere. Some really cold hands and 60 km in a straight line down the stone desert. We were really happy to eat lots of chocolate and candy in our tent before going to sleep.
      </p>
      <br>
       <h3>Day 5</h3>
      
      <p>
       Clothes had been constantly wet from day 1 and our feet were feeling it a bit. We kept moving forward over the highlands.   

      </p>
      <br>
       <h3>Day 6</h3>
    
      <p>
       At last made it out of the highland and down to Laugavegor, a popular hiking area and trail down south. This is a very beautiful place and really something extraordinary. We almost completely forget how our legs felt when looking at the views in front of us. This is where wild camping starts being forbidden and you're referred to specific campsites (we wild camped).
      </p>
      <br>
       <h3>Day 7</h3>
      
      <p>
       Having pretty much not seen anyone for a while we were shocked by all the people here on the Laugavegur trail. Hundreds of people, who often looked like it was their first time outside a city, came wandering down the trail wearing rain ponchos and expedition down jackets even if the sun was out and we wore a t-shirt. The views were some of the most beautiful we had seen though. By the end of this day our legs were screaming for help and we clocked in about 55 km over the mountains. 

      </p>
      <br>
       <h3>Day 8</h3>
    
      <p>
       The last day was shorter and we were both happy to be close to the end but also sad to leave this beautiful place. Just a short push over the last mountain and we could see the south coast. We walked/ran down and well at the end point we felt pretty happy with our adventure. This moment was quickly ruined by a super annoying British guy, who came to brag about his mega 30 km hike he had accomplished. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Highlights and challenges</h3>
      
      <p>
        So why would we recommend you to do this yourself? Well, we wouldn't really. But jokes aside, Iceland is a very beautiful place and what better way to explore than to walk over the entire country. The mountains up north are beautiful, the highlands make you feel both alive and like you're on another planet and the mountains down south are stunning. The hot springs, volcanoes and geysers in the southern part are popular to visit and are definitely worth it. But so are the fjord-like valleys and mountains up north.
