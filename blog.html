        During the summer of 2025, we set out on an expedition to cross Iceland on foot completely self-supported. This route took us through lava deserts, glacial rivers, mossy valleys, and brutally remote landscapes. We carried everything on our backs and avoided any paid accommodation or resupply points.
The idea came to life just a few weeks earlier. During our research we found little to no information about how to do it and if it was even possible. 
The thought of a difficult expedition, almost no one else had done, was enough for us to book a one-way ticket and start our journey. In this blog we cover everything from preparation, planning, gear and breakdown from start to finish of the Iceland crossing. By this we hope to inspire others to go out and try to beat our time.   </p>

      <h3>Planning of the route</h3>
      <p>
        Crossing the country from shore to shore is probably the biggest challenge for hikers when coming to Iceland. When choosing a path there are numerous different aspects to think about and possible routes to choose from. 
The first one connects the two extreme points and starts in Rifstangi, which is the most northern point on the mainland and goes down over the highlands all the way to Kötlutangi, the southernmost point. 
The length of this route is approximately 560km and mostly follow F-roads (Jeep roads that cross the highland) and hiking trails. 
Another option, and the one we opted for, goes from the north coast to south coast starting in Akureyri and finishing down south by Skógar. This option is approximately 350 - 400 km depending on exact starting / finishing point and choice of route along the way. This is probably the fastest and most recommended way of crossing the country of Iceland. Akureyri is the biggest town up north and is accessible from Reykjavik by bus. We opted to hitch hike which also worked out great. The longest and most challenging way crossing Iceland is from west to east. The recommended time is 3-4 weeks and since we don't have any experience about this, go to Andrew Skurkas web page, who's done it himself. 

Doing a hike like this might not be the most enjoyable challenge for most people. Mostly because of the all year round cold rainy weather, loneliness and long straight gravel roads. But for the small percentage of hikers who love the idea of doing something not a lot of others even dare attempt, this is the perfect challenge. 

When planning this our biggest concern was that the infamous rivers on the highland would be too big to cross on foot. We were recommended by locals to contact the search and rescue teams and the huts out on the highlands to get information about the conditions, and to let them know of our planned expedition and estimated time of arrival at the end. This is for safety reasons in case something would have happened and be in need of rescue. To be short, the office on google maps in Reykjavik didn’t exist and no one answered our phone calls. But if you are gonna try this yourself, please give it another go.
